|Name |Description

|Interoperability
|Trace-X must use EDC together with Catena-X approved data models to guarantee interoperability between participants.

|Data Sovereignty
|Data owners and data consumers have to use usage policies for offering, consuming and therefore transferring data.

|Kubernetes for Container Orchestration
|Catena-X requires the application to run in a Kubernetes environment, deployed via Helm Charts.

|Catena-X UUX Guidance (CX Style Guide)
|Frontend follows Catena-X wide UUX consistency according to CX Style Guide

|Name |Description

|Schedule
|Start of development in July 2022. Further development in alignment with the Foundation of the Catena-X Automotive Network e.V. requirements and timeline.

|Process model
|Iterative and incremental. SAFe Framework is used to align with Catena-X services, prerequisites, components and requirements to be Catena-X compatible.

|Catena-X services / requirements
|Trace-X needs to be Catena-X compliant and the application has to follow the CX standards as well as interact with the core services and components.

|Release as Open Source
|The source code, at least parts of it, are made available as open source and can be found in Github Catena-X ng as well as in Eclipse Tractus-X.

|Technology Readiness Level (TRL) for Products developed within the CX Consortia
|As Trace-X is a reference implementation, the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) must not be above TRL 8.
