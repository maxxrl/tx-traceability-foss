= Quality scenarios

The initial letters of the scenario identifiers (IDs) in the following table each stand for the higher-level quality characteristic. For example M for maintainability. These identifiers are also used in the quality tree. The scenarios cannot always be clearly assigned to a characteristic. Therefore, they sometimes appear more than once in the quality tree.

|===
|ID |Scenario

|M01
|A developer with basic knowledge of the Traceability Use Case looks for an introduction to the Traceability architecture. He or she gets the idea of essential design very fast.

|M02
|A senior developer looks for a reference implementation of the Traceability Use case functionalities. He or she gets it within the source code.

|M03
|A developer wants to implement new features. He or she is able to add it to the source code easily.

|M04
|A developer wants to implement a new Frontend or change some components. The efforts can be reduced by using the standardized API endpoints to do so.

|I01
|An user wants to switch from FOSS application to a COTS application or the other way round. This is possible since the application is interoperable with other applications within the CX network.

|F01
|The application uses the Catena-X standards to ensure the correct interoperability and exchange with other participants.

|F02
|An OEM or Tier n supplier needs more information regarding specific parts. He can mark the parts in question and send a top-down notification (Quality Investigation) to the next entity / the partner.

|F03
|A company wants to have more transparency and a visualized status of the supply / value chain. By using the application they are enabled to work with the structures and enable new features / functionalities.

|F04
|Notifications are sent using the EDC to ensure interoperability and reliability to the CX network.

|E01
|Notifications between traceability apps need to be send out and received within a specified timeframe to minimize the negative impact of e.g. recalled serialized products/batches on the value chain.
