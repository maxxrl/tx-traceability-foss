==== Overview

When a user requests a specific asset, TraceX-FOSS checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR', 'ROLE_USER'). If yes, then the endpoint returns a precise Asset for the given assetId, if it is found.

If no asset has been found for the given ID, an AssetNotFoundException is thrown.
