== Overview

Data is fetched by a Trace-X instance using Digital Twin Registry (DTR), Item Relationship Service (IRS) and Trace-X Consumer EDC. Data has to be provided to the Catena-X network using a EDC Provider, since Trace-X is not a data provider and therefore no possibility for data provisioning with Trace-X exists.
For digital twins the Asset Administration Shell (AAS) standard is used. For fetching data with Trace-X, a Digital Twin Registry and an IRS instance are required. Data should represent parts, supplier and customer parts, parts tree / parts relations.
