==== Overview

When a user requests detailed information for assets, TraceX-FOSS checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR', 'ROLE_USER'). If yes, then the endpoint returns a list containing all the stored information for the given assetId, if they are found.

If no asset has been found, an empty list will be returned.

This information for an asset can contain the name of the manufacturer, the manufacturer part ID, the manufacturer name, the manufacturing country, etc.
