==== Overview

When a user requests the map of assets, TraceX-FOSS checks if the user has an adequate role ('ROLE_ADMIN', 'ROLE_SUPERVISOR', 'ROLE_USER'). If yes, then the endpoint returns a JAVA map containing a country names as keys and the number of assets stored for each country and for the given assetId, if they are found.

If no asset has been found, an empty JAVA map will be returned.
